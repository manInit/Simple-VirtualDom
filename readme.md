# Virtual DOM
Simple realization virtual dom with reactivity.
Also i remade slider from Genshin Impact site (https://genshin.mihoyo.com)
And it works. We change only state slider and it update automatically


### vNode contains only 
- tagName
- Attrs (handlers event too)
- Childrens


### examples
made state reactivity. with patch dom on update state
js```
this.state = reactive(this.state);
    let vTree, rootNode;
    watchEffect(() => {
      if (!rootNode) {
        vTree = this.getVSliderEl();
        rootNode = render(vTree);
      } else {
        let newVTree = this.getVSliderEl();
        const patch = diff(vTree, newVTree);
        patch(rootNode);
        vTree = newVTree;
      }
    });
```
